# wiki-wiever

Application: https://marjanus.github.io/wiki-viewer/

The application was built with React and React-Bootstrap. Requests to Wikipedia's MediaWiki action API were made with Axios.
Further responsive design enhacements were made with react-responsive media queries module.

There is a possibility to repeat a recent search on tablets (devices with a minimum width of 768px), or bigger devices. Adjustments for this functionality can be made in the app/components/Viewer.js component.
